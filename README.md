# Web-logbook

This is a simple, free and opensource EASA-style logbook application written in golang and react.

You can clone the repo and compile the binaries yourself, or just download the latest ones for your operating system from the [releases](https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook/releases).

Once you start the app it automatically creates an SQLite local DB and starts listening on port 4000 by default. So you can open it in your standard web browser at http://localhost:4000

You also can easily export all flight records into EASA style pdf format, print it, sign and use it as a usual paper logbook.

# Airports Databases

The app supports 3 sources:
* https://github.com/mwgg/Airports/raw/master/airports.json - main JSON database of 28k+ airports.
* (default) https://github.com/vsimakhin/Airports/raw/master/airports.json - my local fork of the main JSON database,  to ensure that the app remains functional even if there are any breaking changes in the upstream.
* https://davidmegginson.github.io/ourairports-data/airports.csv - an alternate set of airports from https://ourairports.com/, which contains over 78k records, including small airfields and heliports. 

If you enable the `No ICAO codes filter` option, the app will ignore ICAO airport codes that contain numbers and dashes, which are not commonly used ICAO codes. By default, this option is unchecked, which makes the database slightly smaller and cleaner.

# Advanced configuration

## Docker

Check [readme](./docker/README.md) for dockerized app for more details.

## HTTPS enable

You can generate your own certificate and key and store it in the different directories in your operating system. For that use `--key` and `--cert` parameters to specify the exact location and wun app with `--enable-https` flag.

## MySQL database

To store all data, you can use MySQL database. To get started, create a database and a user with access to it. On the first run, the application will create all necessary tables and views. If you want to migrate your data from SQLite to MySQL, you can use the export to CSV function first and then import from CSV.

The DSN format for MySQL connections 
```
user:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value
```

For example, 
```
./web-logbook -engine mysql -dsn "web-logbook-user:pwd@tcp(192.168.0.222)/web-logbook"
```

## API

The backend exposes a REST (sort of) API for access to all logbook functionality. You can find the full list of the endpoints here https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook/blob/main/app/routes.go#L26

### Authentication

If authentication is enabled you need to use Bearer token

```bash
# get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"login": "login", "password": "password"}' | jq -r '.token')

# run request
curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/export/A4 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --output logbook.pdf
```

Powershel for Windows (generated by ChatGPT)
```powershell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/login" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{"login": "login", "password": "password"}'

$token = $response.token

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/export/A4" `
  -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $token" } `
  -OutFile "logbook.pdf"
```

### API examples

Download PDF A4 logbook
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/export/A4 --output logbook.pdf
```

Get distance between LKPR and EDDM airports in nautical miles
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/distance/LKPR/EDDM
```

# New features/Issues

In case you'd like to add some other features to the logbook or you found a bug, please open an "issue" here https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook/issues with a description. I cannot promise I'll implement it or fix it at a reasonable time but at least I can take a look.
