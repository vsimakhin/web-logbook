  - The image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` now
  - The entrypoint and cmd are changed. If you don't see data with the new image try to remove `./web-logbook` from the command

  ```
  - **BREAKING**: If you encounter errors like the one shown below, verify the access rights and ownership of your `web-logbook.sql` file. Ensure it is owned by the current user rather than root, and update the ownership if necessary.
  ```bash
  SQL logic error: no such table: metadata (1)

## [2.31.0] - 27.01.2024

## [2.28.0] - 25.12.2023

Or there was quite a high error if the flight was close to the North or South poles. The new algorithm divides the flight for the segments <1 minute and checks the sunrise/sunset time for each of them, and then summarises the total night time.

## [2.20.3] - 16.04.2023

- Fix: The main logbook table pagination was broken due to wrong variable type (string instead of int)

## [2.20.2] - 15.04.2023

## [2.20.0] - 13.04.2023

- New: Slightly updated the `Licensing` table and added a check for the expired or expiring soon licenses. The warning will appear in the left navigation bar, however, there is still an option to disable the badge in the `Settings` page if it's too annoying.
- New: Added airport database synchronization with a mobile app.
- Update: Moved code that calculates a night time from the package to the internal module - easier troubleshooting and it was used as an example for adding the same functionality to the mobile app
- Fix: Remarks in the main logbook table are truncated depends on the screen width.
- Update: New version for the go-nighttime package, which uses a different library for calculating sunrise and sunset. It might not as precise as the previous one (the difference is up to 2 minutes depending on the flight time), but the calculation is much faster (1000 times) and it doesn't need a time zone database, which makes the binary file up to 15MB less.
- Fix: Show values on the charts (tooltip) in the proper format - HH:MM for time fields, and XXX XXX nm for distance

## [2.19.0] - 06.04.2023

- New: Added a check if the flight or simulator record already exists during the import

The new signature pad on the `Settings` page allows you to write/draw your signature in any color or upload it from a file (`*.png` format only, and should be with transparent background). And then you can "turn it on" for each PDF export format with a checkbox `Include signature`
- New: Added new setting `Replace SE and ME values for single pilot time with "✓" symbol` for PDF export formats. It's according to EASA Part FCL.050 logbook example https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/Part-FCL.pdf

- New: Added options to hide some columns for the Stats tables (you can find them in the `Settings`)
- New: Added Cross Country for the Stats tables
- New: Added new field `Stats tables font size` on the `Settings` page - due to a lot of columns the table layout can be broken on the smaller screens, so you can set your font size from 50% to 100%

## [2.10.1] - 10.12.2022

- Fix: Updated alert info fields to show the proper color as well (green/red)

## [2.10.0] - 10.12.2022

- Updated: unit tests were redesigned and updated, making them more reliable and not random sometimes. This doesn't affect UI or functionality, just an internal thing

- New: a date range field (https://www.daterangepicker.com/) for the logbook, stats, and maps pages with some predefined values (last 30 days, this month etc) and the possibility to select a custom range. This one probably will cause some hidden bugs in UI, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯*
- New: Started to write a changelog to track the changes, fixes and so on in one file
